# Forensic Notes and Preservation Statement  
## Evidence Handling, Metadata Integrity and Chain of Custody

### Scope
This note documents the handling, preservation, and safeguarding of digital evidence associated with the forensic-scientific work  
**SIA Security Intelligence Artefact – Technology, Software and Family History**  
**Case Reference:** INT-CODE-2025-BTC/ETH-CORE-ISABELSCHOEPSTHIEL

---

## Evidence Handling and Non-Alteration Policy

All relevant files, including raw data, source materials, and documentary artefacts, were transferred into a dedicated **Evidence** directory for preservation and review.

No internal file contents were modified.  
No code, text, metadata, authorship fields, user identifiers, timestamps, or embedded provenance information were altered.

Specifically preserved without change:
- Original creators and contributors as recorded in file metadata  
- User identifiers and authorship traces  
- Timestamps, hashes, and internal history  
- Programming language, workflow logic, and structural dependencies inside the files  

The original provenance and authorship of each file therefore remain fully readable and forensically extractable.

---

## File System Safety Measures

To prevent any further unintended execution, propagation, or operational misuse of potentially harmful workflows, only **external file and folder names** were adjusted at the file-system level.

These actions were limited to:
- Renaming folders and top-level file names  
- Disabling executable or workflow-triggering identifiers  

No internal data, code, or metadata were altered.  
These measures were implemented solely to prevent further operational impact while preserving evidentiary value.

---

## Ethical and Legal Context

During review, multiple files indicated **serious ethical and legal concerns**, including but not limited to:
- Unauthorized manipulation of data  
- Data misuse and data theft  
- Misappropriation of intellectual property  
- Invasive profiling or exploitative data practices  

For this reason, operational execution was neutralized while forensic preservation was strictly maintained.

---

## Screenshot-Based Evidence Capture

For evidentiary verification, **screenshots were taken at each relevant stage** and stored within the Evidence directory.

The screenshots:
- Remain unedited and unlabelled  
- Preserve original folder structures and visual context  
- Display usernames, account identifiers, and responsible actors visible at the time of capture  

This ensures that all observed actors, file ownerships, and directory relationships remain objectively documented and reviewable.

---

## Forensic Integrity

All actions taken were designed to satisfy the following principles:
- No contamination of original data  
- No destruction or modification of metadata  
- Full traceability for independent forensic analysis  
- Preservation of evidentiary admissibility  

All materials are suitable for hash verification, chain-of-custody tracking, and independent expert review.

# Attention - this Ontology Development Kit is Evidence 

<img src="https://github.com/jmcmurry/closed-illustrations/raw/master/logos/odk-logos/odk-logo_black-banner.png" />

Manage your ontology's life cycle with the Ontology Development Kit (ODK)! The ODK is
- a toolbox of various ontology related tools such as ROBOT, owltools, dosdp-tools and many more, bundled as a docker image
- a set of executable workflows for managing your ontology's continuous integration, quality control, releases and dynamic imports

# Requirements

## Docker

Using the ODK docker image requires Docker Engine version 20.10.8 or greater for v1.3.1.

# Tips and Tricks

## Customizing your ODK installation

You will likely want to customize the build process, and of course to edit the ontology.

We recommend that you do not edit the main Makefile, but instead the supplemental one (e.g. myont.Makefile) is src/ontology

An example of how you can customise your imports for example is documented [here](http://pato-ontology.github.io/pato/odk-workflows/RepoManagement/)

## Migrating an existing ontology repo to the ODK

The ODK is designed for creating a new repo for a new ontology. It can also be used to help figure out how to migrate an existing git repository to the ODK structure. There are different ways to do this.

 * Manually compare your ontology against the [template](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/tree/master/template) folder and make necessary adjustments
 * Run the seed script as if creating a new repo. Manually compare this with your existing repo and use `git mv` to rearrange, and adding any missing files by copying them across and doing a `git add`
 * Create a new repo de novo and abandon your existing one, using, for example, github issue mover to move tickets across.

Obviously the second method is not ideal as you lose your git history. Note even with `git mv` history tracking becomes harder.

If you have built your ontology using a previous version of ODK,
migration of your setup is unfortunately a manual process. In general
you do not absolutely *need* to upgrade your setup, but doing so will
bring advantages in terms of aligning with emerging standards ways of
doing things. The less customization you do on your repo the easier it
should be to migrate.

Consult the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) file for changes made between
releases to assist in upgrading.

## More documentation

You will find additional documentation in the src/ontology/README-editors.md file in your repo.

The ODK also comes with built in options to generate your own shiny documentation; see for example the [PATO documentation here](http://pato-ontology.github.io/pato/) which is almost entirely autogenerated from the ODK.

## Alternative to Docker

You can run the seed script without docker using Python3.6 or
higher and Java. See requirements.txt for python requirements.

*This is, however, not recommended.*
