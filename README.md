# Forensic Evidence Repository  
## Intellectual Property, Data Misuse and Human Rights Documentation

## Repository Purpose
This repository serves as a **forensic evidence index and documentation layer** for preserved digital artefacts related to the **unauthorized acquisition, processing, profiling, and exploitation of proprietary intellectual work and associated data**.  
It is designed for **judicial review, human rights assessment, and independent technical verification**.

No speculative or metaphysical claims are made. All content is limited to **technical findings, documented data structures, observed correlations, and verified preservation procedures**.

---

## Scope of the Evidence
The evidence documented and referenced in this repository includes:

- Unauthorized copies of proprietary intellectual work and cognitive work products  
- Identity-linked metadata and attribution structures  
- Behavioral, biometric, or physiological response indicators used for profiling  
- Audit trails, mappings, and correlation datasets  
- Forensic documentation and chain-of-custody records  

This repository **does not host raw personal data**. It functions as a **controlled reference and verification index**.

---

## Evidence Preservation and Integrity
All referenced artefacts have been preserved according to forensic best practices:

- Read-only acquisition and storage  
- Cryptographic hashing for integrity verification  
- Versioned archival with persistent identifiers  
- Documented chain of custody  
- Logged access and handling  

The integrity of each artefact is verifiable through **independent checksum validation and DOI-based archival records**.

---

## Chain of Custody and Archival References
The complete chain of custody is archived on the internationally recognized research repository **Zenodo**, ensuring immutability, citability, and long-term availability.

The evidence chain is structured into four interdependent volumes:

### Volume 1 – Initial Artefacts and Foundational Evidence
**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17809724  

**Function:**  
Establishes the foundational artefacts, initial preservation steps, and technical baseline of the evidence chain.

---

### Volume 2 – Forensic Chain of Custody Documentation
**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17852789  

**Function:**  
Core forensic documentation, including chain-of-custody records, attribution analysis, and documented misuse patterns related to intellectual property and data exploitation.

---

### Volume 3 – Historical and Contextual Forensic Analysis
**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17897358  

**Function:**  
Contextual and historical analysis relevant to attribution, provenance, and structural interpretation of the evidence.

---

### Volume 4 – Integrated Forensic and Scientific Expert Report
**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17808895  

**Function:**  
Comprehensive expert assessment integrating technical, historical, and forensic findings across the full evidence chain.

---

## Legal and Human Rights Context
The documented evidence is evaluated within the framework of:

- Intellectual property protection  
- Data protection and privacy law  
- Prohibition of unauthorized profiling and non-consensual data-driven experimentation  
- International human rights standards, including human dignity and personal integrity  

The evidence is intended to support **independent legal, forensic, and human rights review**.

---

## Intended Use
This repository is intended for:

- Judicial and quasi-judicial proceedings  
- United Nations mechanisms and special procedures  
- Human rights organizations and oversight bodies  
- Independent forensic and academic review  

It is **not** intended for sensational, defamatory, or speculative use.

---

## Access Policy
- No raw personal data is published in this repository.  
- Full datasets are disclosed **only to authorized judicial, investigative, or human rights institutions** upon formal request.  
- All disclosures are logged and documented.

---

## Verification
Independent reviewers can verify:

- DOI integrity via Zenodo  
- Hash consistency across archived artefacts  
- Internal consistency of chain-of-custody records  
- Reproducibility of documented findings  

---

## Disclaimer
This repository documents **technical evidence and forensic observations only**.  
It does not assert guilt, make metaphysical claims, or replace judicial determination.  
All conclusions are limited to **documented data structures, observed correlations, and verified preservation records**.
